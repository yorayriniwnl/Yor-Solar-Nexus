# Yor-Solar-Nexus
A cloud-based platform for solar energy planning and optimization. It evaluates location feasibility, assesses energy needs, estimates cost savings, and provides subsidy and rooftop guidance. Designed for personalized analysis, scalability, and collaborative research to support informed solar adoption.

## Problem Statement
Despite the growing adoption of solar energy, users lack an integrated platform to assess feasibility, cost-benefit, and rooftop suitability while accounting for local conditions and policies.

## Objectives
- Analyze location-based solar feasibility
- Estimate household or organizational energy demand
- Calculate potential cost savings from solar adoption
- Provide rooftop suitability and subsidy guidance
- Support collaborative and scalable analysis

## Scope
This project focuses on software-based analysis and optimization for solar energy planning. Hardware implementation and physical installation are outside the project scope.

## Tech Stack (Tentative)
- Python
- Cloud-based data storage
- GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Data visualization libraries

## Project Status
🚧 Initial setup completed (Repository, License, README structure)
